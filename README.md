## Proplem Setting
### With the mega storm last Christmas, there was a cascade of flights cancelled -- thousands! How would you figure out what the planes and flight crews should do, given the uncertain nature of air travel?
## Constraint Programming
### The variables in this scenario could be the flight schedules, the flight crews, and the planes. 
### The domains of the variables could be the possible flight schedules, the flight crews available, and the planes available. 
### The constraints could be the availability of flight crews, the availability of planes, and the minimum rest time required for flight crews.
## Bayes Nets
### The random variables in this scenario could be the weather conditions, the number of flight cancellations, and the flight schedule changes. 
### The variables could be connected such that the weather conditions affect the number of flight cancellations, and the number of flight cancellations affects the flight schedule changes. 
### The hidden variables could be the weather conditions, and the observed variables could be the number of flight cancellations and the flight schedule changes. 
### The Bayes Net could be used to make predictions about the number of flight cancellations and the flight schedule changes given the current weather conditions.
## Deep Learning
### The architecture that could be used in this scenario could be a neural network that takes in the weather conditions as inputs and outputs the number of flight cancellations and the flight schedule changes. 
### The training data could be collected from previous flight cancellations and flight schedule changes and used to train the neural network.
